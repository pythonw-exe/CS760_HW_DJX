\section{Questions (50 pts)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item (9 pts) Explain whether each scenario is a classification or regression problem. And, provide the number of data points ($n$) and the number of features ($p$).

\begin{enumerate}
	\item (3 pts) We collect a set of data on the top 500 firms in the US. For each firm we record profit, number of employees, industry and the CEO salary. We are interested in predicting CEO salary with given factors.
	
	\begin{soln}
 Regression problem, since the output (CEO salary) is continues rather than discrete. n = 500, since they collect data on the top 500 firms; p=3, since they record profit, number of employees, industry.
 \end{soln}
	
	\item (3 pts) We are considering launching a new product and wish to know whether it will be a success or a failure. We collect data on 20 similar products that were previously launched. For each product we have recorded whether it was a success or failure, price charged for the product, marketing budget, competition price, and ten other variables.
	
	\begin{soln}
 Classification problem, since the output is discrete(binary). n = 20, since they collect data on 20 products; p=13 corresponding to  price charged for the product, marketing budget, competition price, and ten other variables
 \end{soln}
	
	\item (3 pts) We are interesting in predicting the \% change in the US dollar in relation to the weekly changes in the world stock markets. Hence we collect weekly data for all of 2012. For each week we record the \% change in the dollar, the \% change in the US market, the \% change in the British market, and the \% change in the German market.
	
	\begin{soln}
 Regression problem, since the \% change in US dollar is continuous. n = 52, since 2012 has 52 weeks; p = 3, since they collect US, German, and British market.
 \end{soln}
	
\end{enumerate}

\item (6 pts) The table below provides a training data set containing six observations, three predictors, and one qualitative response variable.

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{ c  c  c  c}
		\hline
		$X_{1}$ & $X_{2}$ & $X_{3}$ & $Y$ \\ \hline
		0 & 3 & 0 & Red \\
		2 & 0 & 0 & Red \\
		0 & 1 & 3 & Red \\
		0 & 1 & 2 & Green \\
		-1 & 0 & 1 & Green \\
		1 & 1 & 1 & Red  \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Suppose we wish to use this data set to make a prediction for $Y$ when $X_{1} = X_{2} = X_{3} = 0$ using K-nearest neighbors.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item (2 pts) Compute the Euclidean distance between each observation and the test point, $X_{1} = X_{2} = X_{3}=0$.
 
	\begin{soln}
 \begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{c  c  c  c  c c}
		\hline
		No. & $X_{1}$ & $X_{2}$ & $X_{3}$ & $Y$ & d \\ \hline
		1 & 0 & 3 & 0 & Red & 3\\
		2 & 2 & 0 & 0 & Red & 2\\
		3 & 0 & 1 & 3 & Red & $\sqrt{10}$\\
		4 & 0 & 1 & 2 & Green & $\sqrt{5}$\\
		5 & -1 & 0 & 1 & Green & $\sqrt{2}$\\
		6 & 1 & 1 & 1 & Red  & $\sqrt{3}$\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{soln}
 
	\item (2 pts) What is our prediction with $K=1$? Why?
	
	\begin{soln}
 Green, since 5th is the closest data point with $d=\sqrt{2}$, and it is green.
 \end{soln}
	
	\item (2 pts) What is our prediction with $K=3$? Why?
	
	\begin{soln} Red, since 5th, 6th, and 2nd are the closest three data points, with $d=\sqrt{2}$, $d=\sqrt{3}$ $d=2$ respectively. There are two red one green, so it predicts red.\end{soln}

\end{enumerate}

\item (12 pts) When the number of features $p$ is large, there tends to be a deterioration in the performance of KNN and other local approaches that perform prediction using only observations that are near the test ob- servation for which a prediction must be made. This phenomenon is known as the curse of dimensionality, and it ties into the fact that non-parametric approaches often perform poorly when $p$ is large.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item (2pts) Suppose that we have a set of observations, each with measurements on $p=1$ feature, $X$. We assume that $X$ is uniformly (evenly) distributed on [0, 1]. Associated with each observation is a response value. Suppose that we wish to predict a test observation’s response using only observations that are within 10\% of the range of $X$ closest to that test observation. For instance, in order to predict the response for a test observation with $X=0.6$, we will use observations in the range [0.55, 0.65]. On average, what fraction of the available observations will we use to make the prediction?
	
	\begin{soln}  On average, we would use 0.0975 fraction of the observations to make the prediction.
 $$\int_{0.05}^{0.95} 0.1 dx +\int_{0}^{0.05} (x+0.05) dx + \int_{0.95}^{1} (1.05-x) dx = 0.0975$$
 
 \end{soln}
	
	
	\item (2pts) Now suppose that we have a set of observations, each with measurements on $p =2$ features, $X1$ and $X2$. We assume that predict a test observation’s response using only observations that $(X1,X2)$ are uniformly distributed on [0, 1] × [0, 1]. We wish to are within 10\% of the range of $X1$ and within 10\% of the range of $X2$ closest to that test observation. For instance, in order to predict the response for a test observation with $X1 =0.6$ and $X2 =0.35$, we will use observations in the range [0.55, 0.65] for $X1$ and in the range [0.3, 0.4] for $X2$. On average, what fraction of the available observations will we use to make the prediction?
	
	\begin{soln} Since there are 2 features, and the 2 features are in independent uniform distributions. Thus the fraction is $0.0975^2 = 0.00950625$ \end{soln}
	
	\item (2pts) Now suppose that we have a set of observations on $p = 100$ features. Again the observations are uniformly distributed on each feature, and again each feature ranges in value from 0 to 1. We wish to predict a test observation’s response using observations within the 10\% of each feature’s range that is closest to that test observation. What fraction of the available observations will we use to make the prediction?
	
	\begin{soln} Similarly, there are 100 features, and the 100 features are in independent uniform distributions. Thus the fraction is $0.0975^{100} \approx 0 $\end{soln}
	
	\item (3pts) Using your answers to parts (a)–(c), argue that a drawback of KNN when p is large is that there are very few training observations “near” any given test observation.
	
	\begin{soln}  One drawback of KNN when p is large is that there are very few training observations "near" any given test observation. As is shown in (a)-(c), the number of observations that are within a certain hypercube decrease exponentially, and approximate to 0 quickly. \end{soln}
	
	\item (3pts) Now suppose that we wish to make a prediction for a test observation by creating a $p$-dimensional hypercube centered around the test observation that contains, on average, 10\% of the training observations. For $p =$1, 2, and 100, what is the length of each side of the hypercube? Comment on your answer.
	
	\begin{soln}
 $(\frac{x}{1})^p = 0.1 \rightarrow x=0.1^{\frac{1}{p}}$ 

 $p=1, x=0.1$
 
 $p=2, x=0.1^{\frac{1}{2}}$
 
 $p=100, x=0.1^{\frac{1}{100}}$
 \end{soln}
	
\end{enumerate}

\item (6 pts) Supoose you trained a classifier for a spam detection system. The prediction result on the test set is summarized in the following table.
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{l l | l l}
		&          & \multicolumn{2}{l}{Predicted class} \\
		&          & Spam           & not Spam           \\
		\hline
		\multirow{2}{*}{Actual class} & Spam     & 8              & 2                  \\
		& not Spam & 16             & 974               
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Calculate
\begin{enumerate}
	\item (2 pts) Accuracy
	\begin{soln}  $= (8+974)/(8+2+16+974)= 0.982$\end{soln}
	\item (2 pts) Precision
	\begin{soln}  $=8/(8+16)= 0.333$\end{soln}
	\item (2 pts) Recall
	\begin{soln}  $=8/(8+2) = 0.8$ \end{soln}
\end{enumerate}


\item (9pts) Again, suppose you trained a classifier for a spam filter. The prediction result on the test set is summarized in the following table. Here, "+" represents spam, and "-" means not spam.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ c  c }
\hline
Confidence positive & Correct class \\ \hline
0.95 & + \\
0.85 & + \\
0.8 & - \\
0.7 & + \\
0.55 & + \\
0.45 & - \\
0.4 & + \\
0.3 & + \\
0.2 & - \\
0.1 & - \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item (6pts) Draw a ROC curve based on the above table.
	
	\begin{soln}  Please refer to Fig.\ref{P1} \end{soln}

   	\begin{figure}[h]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=8cm]{P1.png}
        \caption{Q5(a) figure}
        \label{P1}
	\end{figure}
	
	\item (3pts) (Real-world open question) Suppose you want to choose a threshold parameter so that mails with confidence positives above the threshold can be classified as spam. Which value will you choose? Justify your answer based on the ROC curve.
	
	\begin{soln} I will choose 0.85 or 0.45. If non-spam emails are very important while filtering out every spam emails is not, choosing 0.85 will result in not mis-classifying any important non-spam email into spam and thus miss them while still filtering out some spams. If filtering out every spam emails is very important while non-spam emails are not, choosing 0.45 will make sure that all spam emails are filtered out.\end{soln}
\end{enumerate}

\item (8 pts) In this problem, we will walk through a single step of the gradient descent algorithm for logistic regression. As a reminder,
$$f(x;\theta) = \sigma(\theta^\top x)$$
$$\text{Cross entropy loss } L(\hat{y}, y) = -[y \log  \hat{y} + (1-y)\log(1-\hat{y})]$$
$$\text{The single update step } \theta^{t+1} = \theta^{t} - \eta \nabla_{\theta} L(f(x;\theta), y) $$



\begin{enumerate}
	\item (4 pts) Compute the first gradient $\nabla_{\theta} L(f(x;\theta), y)$.
	
\begin{soln}
$$
\begin{aligned}
&L(f(x;\theta), y) = -[y \log  \sigma(\theta^\top x) + (1-y)\log(1-\sigma(\theta^\top x))]\\
&\nabla_{\theta}L(f(x;\theta), y)\\
=&\frac{dL(f(x,\theta),y)}{df(x,\theta)}\frac{df(x,\theta)}{d\theta}\\
=&\left(-\frac{y}{\sigma(\theta^\top x)}+\frac{(1-y)}{1-\sigma(\theta^\top x)}\right)\left(\sigma(\theta^\top x)(1-\sigma(\theta^\top x))x\right)\\
=&x(\sigma(\theta^\top x)-y)
\end{aligned}
$$
\end{soln}
	
	\item (4 pts)
 Now assume a two dimensional input. After including a bias parameter for the first dimension, we will have $\theta\in\mathbb{R}^3$.
$$ \text{Initial parameters : }  \theta^{0}=[0, 0, 0]$$
$$ \text{Learning rate }\eta=0.1$$
$$ \text{data example : } x=[1, 3, 2], y=1$$
Compute the updated parameter vector $\theta^{1}$ from the single update step.
	
	\begin{soln} $$
\begin{aligned}
 \theta^1 &= \theta^0-\eta x(\sigma(\theta^\top x)-y)\\
&=[0,0,0]-0.1\times [1,3,2] (\frac{1}{2}-1)\\
&=[0.05, 0.15, 0.1]
 \end{aligned}
 $$\end{soln}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Programming (50 pts)}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item (10 pts) Use the whole D2z.txt as training set.  Use Euclidean distance (i.e. $A=I$).
	Visualize the predictions of 1NN on a 2D grid $[-2:0.1:2]^2$.
	That is, you should produce test points whose first feature goes over $-2, -1.9, -1.8, \ldots, 1.9, 2$, so does the second feature independent of the first feature.
	You should overlay the training set in the plot, just make sure we can tell which points are training, which are grid.
	
	The expected figure looks like this.
